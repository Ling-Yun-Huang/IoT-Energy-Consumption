# IoT-Based Energy Consumption Analysis and Forecasting for Building Systems

This project forecasts hourly energy consumption for the next 7 days based on historical data, focusing on **IoT applications** in energy monitoring and smart grids.  

The workflow includes:
- **Feature engineering:** generating time-based features, rolling statistics, and lag features  
- **Model comparison:** training and evaluating four different models to identify the best-performing one  
- **Forecasting:** using the selected model to predict the next 7 days of energy consumption  
- **Visualisation:** comparing historical weekly patterns with forecasts

## Usage
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle:  
   [Energy Consumption Time Series Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ds/2678471)  
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to train models and visualise forecasts.
