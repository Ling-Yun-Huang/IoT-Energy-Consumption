Model Comparison & Forecasting
In this project, multiple models were trained to forecast hourly energy consumption:

Feature Engineering: Temporal features (hour, day, weekday), rolling statistics, and lag features.

Models Compared:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

LSTM (Deep Learning)

After evaluation on historical data, the best-performing model was selected for forecasting the next 7 days.

Forecasting Results
The model outputs hourly predictions for one week.

Historical consumption patterns are visualized as weekly averages (Wedâ€“Tue) for comparison.

Forecast plots help to identify peak usage hours and trends.

Optimization Suggestions
IoT Integration: Use smart meters and IoT sensors to continuously collect real-time data and update forecasts.

Energy Management: Adjust consumption patterns during predicted peak hours to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

Model Improvement: Incorporate additional features such as weather data, holidays, and special events to enhance accuracy.

Deployment: Implement a real-time dashboard to visualize predictions and enable proactive decision-making.
